let country = "United States of America"
let state = "Minnesota"
let city = "Minneapolis"
let street = "Chicago Ave. S."
let buildingNumber = 4500

//Concatenation
let address = country + " " + state + " " + city

let interpolatedAddress = "\(country), \(state), \(city)"
let interpolatedStreetAddress = "\(buildingNumber) \(street)"

//Using String Interpolation we can evaluate more than just strings
